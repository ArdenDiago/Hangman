# Hangman Game Readme

#### Introduction
Welcome to Hangman Game, a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a word letter by letter before they run out of attempts. This game is fun and interactive to test your vocabulary and guessing skills!

#### How to Play
+ Start the Game: Launch the Hangman Game program on your device.

+ Select Difficulty Level: Choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) based on your preference or skill level.

+ Guess the Word: Begin guessing letters one by one. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.

+ Continue Guessing: Keep guessing letters until you either successfully guess the word or make too many incorrect guesses, resulting in the completion of the hangman figure.

+ Win or Lose: If you guess the word correctly before completing the hangman figure, you win! Otherwise, you lose.

+ Play Again: You can choose to play again and try to beat your previous score or challenge yourself with a new word.
